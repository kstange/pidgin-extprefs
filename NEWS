Pidgin Extended Preferences Plugin

Version 0.7 (04/29/2007):

   There's not much changed in this version, but a lot has changed, so
   it's needed.  Gaim is now Pidgin, and so we are now the Pidgin Extended
   Preferences Plugin.  As a result, the plugin has been recoded for the
   new name and API.  Craig has also changed the way the tooltips pref
   works so that it is a bit clearer, and I've fixed the "Hide buddy list
   at startup" pref so that it should really always work.  Other than that,
   we're just releasing so that we're ready for Pidgin 2.0.0 beta 7.

   There should be more new features in the next release, hopefully!

Version 0.6 (03/22/2007):

   This is the first release in very nearly two years.  Development for me
   has basically been at a standstill, mostly because of lack of time, and
   because while Gaim is extremely happily alive, it has been stuck without
   a "real" release for some time and has felt a bit like a moving target.
   This release is to help satisfy many people on Windows that are waiting
   for me to finally release ANYTHING they can install and use.  It also
   makes the plugin fully API compatible with 2.0.0 beta 6 (which should
   be API frozen now for release, I hope) and discontinue support for
   1.5.0, which you simply shouldn't be using anymore.  No new features
   will be found in this release, but the plugin should compile properly on
   2.0.0 beta 6, and better in general elsewhere.

   Also, a warm welcome to Craig Harding, who offered his contributions and
   I have accepted as an official developer of the plugin.  He has some
   ideas for improvements and changes which will certainly appear in the
   next release, 0.7, which we will do our best to deliver in fewer than
   20 months. :)
