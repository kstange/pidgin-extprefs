Gaim Extended Preferences Plugin Installation
==========================================================

Installation of this plugin varies by platform.  Please follow the
appropriate directions below for your platform.

For reference, any time "extendedprefs-version" is mentioned, you should
replace the word "version" with the current version of Extended Prefs,
such as "0.2"

Unix or Linux:
================

Make sure Gaim and its development headers (often a gaim-devel package for
your distribution) are installed on your computer.

Extract the source tarball to the location of your choosing and cd to the
extracted directory:

	tar xzf extendedprefs-version.tar.gz
	cd extendedprefs-version/

To build the plugin, type:

	make

To install the plugin into your Gaim user directory (~/.gaim/plugins), type:

	make install

If you'd rather copy the plugin to your Gaim installation path, specify
the prefix value.  For example, if you want to install the plugin to
/usr/local/lib/gaim/:

	PREFIX="/usr/local" make install

Then simply start or restart Gaim and load the plugin from the Gaim
preferences dialog.

Windows:
================

Extract Gaim source somehow, somewhere, in an appropriate build environment.
The WinGBEF build fetcher <http://gaim-extprefs.sourceforge.net/extras.shtml>
might be able to help you with this task.

Extract the source tarball to the plugins/ directory of the gaim source and
cd to the extracted directory:

	tar xzf extendedprefs-version.tar.gz
	cd extendedprefs-version/

To build the plugin, type:

	make

If necessary, Gaim's source should be built automatically as it is required
to install plugins.

Once this is complete, you can install the plugin to the win32-install-dir
directory, which is usually used for building packages by typing:

	make install

If you'd rather just use the plugin with your regular Gaim installation,
copy the extendedprefs.dll file from the extendedprefs-version/src/
directory to your user plugins directory:

	Windows 98/Me:
	c:\windows\Application Data\.gaim\plugins (default user)
	c:\windows\profiles\<username>\Application Data\.gaim\plugins

	Windows 2000/XP:
	c:\documents and settings\<username>\Application Data\.gaim\plugins

Then simply start or restart Gaim and load the plugin from the Gaim
preferences dialog.
