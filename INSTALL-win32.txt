Gaim Extended Preferences Plugin Installation
==========================================================

To use this plugin with your regular Gaim installation, extract and copy
the extendedprefs.dll file from the zip file to your Gaim user plugins
folder:

	Windows 95/98/Me:
	c:\windows\Application Data\.gaim\plugins (default user)
	c:\windows\profiles\<username>\Application Data\.gaim\plugins

	Windows NT 4.0:
	c:\winnt\profiles\<username>\Application Data\.gaim\plugins

	Windows 2000/XP/2003:
	c:\documents and settings\<username>\Application Data\.gaim\plugins

The "plugins" folder will not exist unless you have previously installed a
3rd party plugin there.  You should create this folder on your own and place
the plugin there.

If you are unable to locate ".gaim" in your "Application Data" folder, please
either run Gaim once so that it creates this folder or create the ".gaim"
folder manually.

Then simply start or restart Gaim and load the plugin from the Gaim
preferences dialog.
