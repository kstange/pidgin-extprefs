Pidgin Extended Preferences Plugin Installation
==========================================================

To use this plugin with your regular Pidgin installation, extract and copy
the extprefs.dll file from the zip file to your Pidgin user plugins folder:

	Windows 95/98/Me:
	c:\windows\Application Data\.purple\plugins (default user)
	c:\windows\profiles\<username>\Application Data\.purple\plugins

	Windows NT 4.0:
	c:\winnt\profiles\<username>\Application Data\.purple\plugins

	Windows 2000/XP/2003:
	c:\documents and settings\<username>\Application Data\.purple\plugins

	Windows Vista: 
	C:\Program Files\<username>\AppData\Roaming\.purple\plugins

The "plugins" folder will not exist unless you have previously installed a
3rd party plugin there.  You should create this folder on your own and place
the plugin there.

If you are unable to locate ".purple" in your "Application Data" folder, please
either run Pidgin once so that it creates this folder or create the ".purple"
folder manually.

If you have not previously installed this plugin, you can install the plugin
into the appropriate location, then simply open the Plugins dialog to load
it.  If you are upgrading, exit Pidgin first, replace the file, then restart
Pidgin.
