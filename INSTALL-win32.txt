Pidgin Extended Preferences Plugin Installation
==========================================================

To use this plugin with your regular Pidgin installation, extract and copy
the extprefs.dll file from the zip file to your Pidgin user plugins folder:

	Windows 95/98/Me:
	c:\windows\Application Data\.pidgin\plugins (default user)
	c:\windows\profiles\<username>\Application Data\.pidgin\plugins

	Windows NT 4.0:
	c:\winnt\profiles\<username>\Application Data\.pidgin\plugins

	Windows 2000/XP/2003:
	c:\documents and settings\<username>\Application Data\.pidgin\plugins

	Windows Vista: 
	C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\.pidgin\plugins

Note: Be sure to delete any older extendedprefs.dll file, as older versions
of this plugin had a different filename.

The "plugins" folder will not exist unless you have previously installed a
3rd party plugin there.  You should create this folder on your own and place
the plugin there.

If you are unable to locate ".pidgin" in your "Application Data" folder, please
either run Pidgin once so that it creates this folder or create the ".pidgin"
folder manually.

Then simply start or restart Pidgin and load the plugin from the Pidgin
preferences dialog.
