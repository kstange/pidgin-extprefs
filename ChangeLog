Gaim Extended Preferences Plugin

Version 0.5:
	* automake, autoconf are now used to configure the plugin for
	  non-Windows environments. This should fix a lot of build problems.
	  Many, many thanks to Don Seiler for getting the ball rolling.
	* Fixed the bugs which prevented the buddy list shrink and taskbar
	  entry preferences from being honored at load time.
	* Hide Buddy List at Signon option should work more reliably.

Version 0.4 (12/13/2004):
	* Ported the ability to hide the join and part messages from chats
	  from Guifications. (Stu Tomlinson)
	* Added the option to automatically hide the buddy list when it first
	  appears at signon. (Gary Kramlich)
	* Significant code cleanup was done in the UI code.

Version 0.3 (09/16/2004):
	* Gaim 1.x.x binary and source compatibility.
	* Added the option to allow the buddy list to be resized below the
	  usual minimum dimensions. (Daniel Attallah)
	* Fixed the linux Makefile so that it actually defines the version
	  value and compiles. (Stu Tomlinson)
	* The Win32 MinGW detection should be more accurate, and no longer
	  requires sed.

Version 0.2-r1 (08/21/2004):
	* Fixed the linux Makefile so that when the plugin compiles perfectly
	  it is also able to be loaded by Gaim and installs by default to a
	  location that isn't completely nonsensical. (Stu Tomlinson)
	* No binary or source changes were made in this release.

Version 0.2 (08/11/2004):

	* Added the ability to change the interface font sizes for the
	  Buddy List, Information Dialogs, Conversations, and the Log Viewer.
	* Added the ability to show and hide individual function buttons at
	  the bottom of IM and chat windows.
	* Added Unix and Win32 Makefiles. Unix users should be able to build
	  the plugin outside of the Gaim tree. Win32 users will need to
	  extract it to the plugins/ directory of recent Gaim source.

Version 0.1.2 (06/25/2004):

	* Service release for compatibility with Gaim 0.79.
	* Added some checks to prevent crashing if the plugin is loaded by
	  an incompatible Gaim version.  If this happens, font zooming won't
	  work, so a notice will appear to warn the user of this condition.
	* Stopped trying to both add and remove the preference for hiding
	  the IM button bar in conversations because this caused a crash
	  I couldn't find and the former half was not supposed to happen
	  anymore anyway.

Version 0.1.1 (06/01/2004):

	* Service release for compatibility with Gaim 0.78 API.
	* Removed option to hide the IM and Chat function buttons as this
	  functionality is now provided within Gaim.

Version 0.1 (04/23/2004):

	* Added option to set a zoom on all conversation windows' font
	  sizes.
	* Added option to hide the IM and Chat function buttons.
	* Added interface to Gaim's hidden option for changing the tooltip
	  delay.  Setting this to 0 turns off tooltips.
	* Added option to hide the buddy list entry in your taskbar, if your
	  window manager supports this hint.
