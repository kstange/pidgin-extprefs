To Do for Gaim Extended Preferences
=====================================

[ Will Happen Soon ]

* Convert the existing UI into a GtkNotebook separating different categories.

* Provide a function to restore certain buttons to the conversation window;
  particularly the Get Info button and the Add/Remove button (in HEAD).

[ Still Considering Viability ]

* Trillian style offline buddies group in the buddy list.  Is this even
  technically possible given the API?

* Preference tree editor.
